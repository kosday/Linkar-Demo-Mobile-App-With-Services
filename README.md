LinkarViewFiles (Shared Project) 

LinkarViewFiles.Android. 

LinkarViewFiles.IOS. 


All 3 projects are created automatically when you choose Cross-Platform Mobile Application template (Xamarin.Forms). Within this template you select the platform where it is addressed (Android and IOS) and  code sharing strategy (shared project). This demo uses the Master-Detail template as a base.

Calls are made to a web service from the shared project that gives us the database information to feed the different pages.

# Login
Access data  is not captured on the screen in this project, in this case we have  established them internally. We only use this page to generate a token against the web service that validates us for the rest of the calls

# About Demo
